Library Management System
ðŸ”¹ Introduction
The goal of this course project is to design and implement a full-featured library management system that facilitates both administrative and user interactions. The system is composed of two major components:
1.	Back-end â€“ implemented as a RESTful Web API using ASP.NET Core
2.	Front-end â€“ implemented with Blazor
The application aims to support essential library functionalities such as book browsing, reservations, track penalties.
ðŸ”¹ System Architecture and Technologies
â€¢	Back-end: ASP.NET Core Web API
â€¢	Front-end: Blazor
â€¢	Database: SQL Server using Entity Framework Core (Code-First approach)
â€¢	Authentication: JWT Tokens
â€¢	Object Mapping: AutoMapper
â€¢	Validation: Data Annotations + FluentValidation
ðŸ”¹ Core Functionalities
âœ… For All Users:
â€¢	Browse books by title, author, or genre
â€¢	Search using multiple filters (e.g., author + genre)
â€¢	Sort and paginate book listings
â€¢	View available copies and book ratings
â€¢	Submit and view reviews
â€¢	Reserve books online
â€¢	Scan entry codes to instantly display book info
ðŸ”’ For Admins Only:
â€¢	Full CRUD access to:
o	Users
o	Books
o	Authors
o	Genres
o	Reservations
o	Reviews
o	Penalties
â€¢	Manage available copies
â€¢	Assign roles and handle penalty payments
ðŸ”¹ Database Design Requirements
The project follows a Code-First approach with the following requirements fulfilled:
User, Book, Author, Genre, Reservation, Penalty
â€¢	Each table has:
o	6 or more columns
o	At least 4 different data types (int, string, DateTime, bool, double)
o	Mandatory fields (e.g., Title, ReservationDate)
o	Text constraints (e.g., MaxLength(100))
ðŸ”¹ Security and Validation
â€¢	Full JWT-based authentication and authorization
â€¢	Role-based access (e.g., Admin vs. Regular User)
â€¢	Form and API validation using both:
o	DataAnnotations (server-side)
o	FluentValidation (complex rules)
â€¢	Client-side input validation with feedback
â€¢	ðŸ“· Book image uploads and previews
